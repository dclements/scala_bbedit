Scala BBEdit Utilities
============

Tools for programming in Scala with BBEdit.

Scripts
=======

These are experimental and extremely rudimentary.  They have little to no error checking
or input validation and they are a little finicky about what you pass into them. 

For the `sbt` scripts select your `build.sbt` file, since that is the directory you
generally want to run `sbt` from. 

For the scala `help` script, select any single word that you want to search on.
